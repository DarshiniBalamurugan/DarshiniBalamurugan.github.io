            <h2>FYP Project  - Understanding the impact of noise pollution on human health</h2>
            <p style="text-align:center;">
                The purpose of the research project is to study noise pollution in Singapore and understand how it affects the mental and physical health in humans. 
                Noise pollution is defined as “regular exposure to elevated sound levels that may lead to adverse effects in humans”. The first part of the research
                will analyze the common noises found in Singapore to determine the sound that is the dominant. Audio files will be shown and the following questions will
                be asked. Please keep these definitions in mind when answering the question.
