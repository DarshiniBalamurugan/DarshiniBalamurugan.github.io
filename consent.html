                You are invited to participate in a research study on dominant noise in Singapore. This study is conducted by Prof Lee Bu Sung, Francis, Associate Professor (SCSE) from Nanyang Technological University.
                <br>
                <br>
                This study will take approximately 10 minutes of your time. You will be asked to complete an online survey about the dominant noise you hear in each clip as well as how the noise feels to you. 
                Some demographic will also be asked for analysis purposes. About 200 people aged 21 and above will be recruited for this research. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Your participation in this study is completely voluntary, and you have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without any penalty. You may skip any questions you do not wish to answer. If you do not wish to complete this survey, just close your browser. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Your participation in this research will be kept confidential, and data will be averaged and reported in aggregate. Your responses will be anonymous and IP addresses will not be collected to guarantee complete anonymity. Possible outlets of dissemination may be included in the findings of the FYP project. Although your participation in this research may not benefit you personally, it will help us understand the common types of noise in Singapore, as well as the general perception people have towards these noises. 
                <br>
                <br>
                There are no risks to individuals participating in this survey beyond those that exist in daily life.
